          p Boba With Buddies is all about making our cities feel more like neighborhoods. We're more "connected" than ever before, but we're also more alone. And all we want to do is bring people together because, well, the world is better that way.

          p We're not doing anything groundbreaking. We're creating something that would've been incredibly unnecessary 20 years ago. But while we get busier, it's easy to forget the value of a conversation for no reason. A conversation that's intentionally unintentional.  JUST KIDDING. Yeah, it's 2020 I think we can all agree this is a load of crap. Maybe just lay low til this pandemic runs its course. Get a sourdough starter or something. Or like, a dog maybe. Honestly let me know if it helps.
